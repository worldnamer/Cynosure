Second play-test, with the expanded rules.

Caveat
I started this game with the thinnest of premises - a boy from the tribe goes missing on the day that the tribe is going to pack up and move on. I really had nothing more planned than this, though I thought Shade of Masks might get involved again. This takes place about a month after the last game. We also brought his character up to spec with the current incarnation of the rules - adding his villainous traits, shrinking his threads, creating a lasting circumstance for him, and giving him the arc The Lost. I made up a first arc point "Purpose - define your purpose." since we didn't have anything yet. We said that his purpose was protecting the innocent, but that he hadn't figured out how to determine who the innocent were.

Synopsis of Events
Angelhorse finds Midnight in the middle of the day, and asks him for his help locating the missing boy Tabel. The young lad is only seven years old, and has gone off by himself. I originally suggested that he might be in the forest again, but the player said that he was fairly sure the boy would be found trying to capture a wild horse. This is where my clever plan to revisit Shade of Masks went off the rails. However, the first rule of Improv is "Say Yes," so I started a conflict on the horse plains to the north. Dave won the conflict, and narrated how he found the trail by discovering the boy's necklace where the tracks merged. His "one thing" otherwise was that he narrated the boy had actually succeeded at getting on the horse and riding off with it. My one thing was that there was a second set of tracks following him - deeper in the ground, and with shod hooves. 

Realizing the boy was in trouble, Midnight pursued the trail. I decided to up the stakes a bit, and had him encounter a trading wagon that had been burnt - all the traders had been callously murdered. We rolled for another conflict, which Dave won; his one thing was that he realized the traders were innocent of wrong-doing when they were killed (which related to his arc.) He narrated how one of the Exalted had used some alchemical reagents that amplified his fire magic when clearly it was completely unnecessary, and that he found the white powder as evidence. My one thing was then that they had this Alchemical Reagent as a Fleeting Circumstance.

Move to a scene where the riders were in hot pursuit of the boy Tabel, who was clinging for dear life to an out-of-control horse. Dave spent one Destiny to activate his thread Plot Conveyance and described how he summons up the shadows to lift him in the air, far faster than any horse could ride. He also made it clear that he would lean down, grab Tabel, and take off from the scene. I was actually pretty darn impressed at this point, so I didn't bother with a conflict. Dave narrated his spend of one Destiny by saying that Tabel is now fascinated by Sorcery and wants to learn to use it to fly. Midnight and Tabel make it safely back to the camp, but the questions lingered: Who were these imperial riders? Why were they so far from home? Why chase Tabel?

Midnight waits for night-fall and summons the spirits using Speak with Shadows. We decide to create a character named Zelthan the Shade. Thinking fast, I stated that Zelthan reveals that the riders were pawns of Shade of Masks; he exerts his baleful influence over them because they carry a powerful artifact that serves as a focus for his energies. This artifact - a torch called the Illuminated Light - is also supposed to provide some shelter for the hideously maddening effects of the City Denandsor whose curse is well-known: all who near it are driven mad. Clearly Shade of Masks must be stopped. Since Dave spent two Destiny, he narrated a Lasting Circumstance for Shade of Masks by sending Zelthan to tell the corrupt being that Midnight would be stopping him. (We added Shaken by the Sun to SoM's character sheet.)

We then had a laughable conflict where the riders and Midnight were in a contest to see who would get there first. I rolled a three on three dice and he rolled an eighteen on three dice. There was also another tiny encounter when Midnight crossed the river and for him to convince some river folk to travel south and not be caught by these villains.

The riders became aware that Midnight was in-between them and their goal, so I had them head west, away from their end goal; I figured that because SoM's plan had been thwarted, he would childishly take his anger out on some hapless Marukani. There was a conflict about this, which I won. During the narration of the conflict, Dave had claimed Perceptive because he thought this was a trick on SoM's part - that the riders were an illusion and had gotten by him. Since I was thinking of other plans, my one thing was that Midnight had become convinced it was a trick and rode back to the city of Denandsor. Meanwhile, that gave them time to head west and pillage and kill a group of over thirty Markukani. Dave's one thing was that this meant the riders would be hunted by the Markuani for their crimes. I wrote "Hunted by Markuani" as a Lasting Circumstance on their sheet.

So, to abridge, Dave catches up with them, brings in the Marukani for another die, uses their alchemical reagents against them, and generally owns me creatively and per the dice in the final attack on those pawns. He narrates in how the riders are all mortally wounded, but that he would get to speak with the leader. He uses this to try to discern how culpable they were for their actions, and realizes that their minds were corrupted by the torch. My one thing is that the leader of the Marukani hunting party was going to claim the torch for his own. This lead into another conflict, which interestingly resulted in a tie. We were a bit uncertain how to resolve it; we finally came to agreement when I said "How about you get the torch, but you decide you have to understand Shade of Masks' plan, so you travel to Denandsor to discover what he was after?" This worked for Dave, so we carried on.

Midnight arrives at the front gates of Denandsor, only the powerful artifact keeping him from pure madness. He decided not to risk discovery from automata by looking for a secret way in. I started a conflict, narrating how such a gate would doubtless be Well Hidden, and how the Ages of Overgrowth would make it especially hard to find. He was, of course, Perceptive, and Stealthy. I then had him find the door, but the door was Locked, to which he retorted that his Mad Brilliance would allow him to figure out how to make it past such a contrivance. We rolled off and he won. Consequences were straightforward.

Midnight decides that before heading to the Denandsor Manse, he would stop at the library to find what information he could on this Illuminated Torch. We roll some dice and he wins. (He had rather hot dice tonight. It actually was okay though.) Midnight learns that the torch was a first age artifact that shows everyone the truth within its pale light. He also deduces that Shade of Mask's corruption has subverted its original intent. During all this, there's some wonderful moral struggling about how Midnight's phantasmal magic is very similar to Shade of Masks' magic and how the torch links them all the more. I think at this point both I and Dave decide to create Ties for the two to the other.

After understanding the torch, Midnight goes to the Manse, which is obviously guarded by automata. These giant robots stand guard in front of the gloriously wrought doors. I narrated in two dice for focus on the sentinels. Dave narrated his stealth, and how he got to the door without being noticed. I then narrated how the doors were warded with ancient magic. Dave then narrated his Mad Brilliance by saying that he would make a lot of noise so that the sentinel would charge him, and accidentally smash the door. Some other stuff got narrated in, and at the end, Dave slipped past the automata and the one that broke the door was damaged by the wards. I created a character named Sentinel B-207 and resolved to have him show up later.

There was some exploring of the Manse which was all handled non-mechanically, and then a secret passage found, blah blah blah. Eventually Midnight reaches a hidden room where the previous ruler of Denandsor lay dead, his bony hand wrapped around a lever of mysterious import. We had a conflict with the raging spirit of the Daimyo, and I narrate in the machine that had caused his death driving the spirit insane. After the roll, Dave wins, and he chooses two consequences (one from the machine spending doom, one from his one thing.) He chooses to 1) have the dissonance engine shut off as a Fleeting Circumstance and 2) that the madness it causes would apply to the Sentinels, such that they would begin attacking each other.

Having dealt with this, Midnight had one last task to do. He sought out the hearthstone of the Manse on the lowest level. We had a conflict which was about the hearthstone trying to attune to him, and the wild geomantic energies that were in play. He ended up spending a Doom to help settle things. He was successful on the roll, but I narrated the Fleeting Circumstance that he Doubted his Virtue - it was obvious from the narration that the reason he wanted to get the hearthstone was to one-up Shade of Masks, not for any compassionate goal.

After this, there was a final conflict in the city where B-207 caught Midnight right as he was leaving the city. Midnight won; it was interesting to play but not to recount.

The final conflict of the game was when Angelhorse kept asking piercing questions about the relationship of Shade of Masks to Midnight, because Dave wanted to keep this intimate connection of his magic to SoM's a secret. I ended up winning this conflict, and decided to give him an out - either come clean about the questionable link, or refuse to answer and leave the tribe. He opted for the latter, which was brilliantly done: he narrated how he evades the questions and tells Angelhorse that it's only a matter of time before Shade of Masks comes after them to hurt him. As such, he must leave the tribe in search of deeper answers. As a parting gift, he summons Zelthan to watch over them and hide them from SoM's arcane sight. As his Lasting Circumstance he chose that it actually work, which I accepted as perfectly in line with the spirit of a lasting circumstance.


System Review
Many aspects of the system work REALLY well. I found that having a piece of paper that I could write character names on to refer to as the story grew organically was beyond helpful. It allowed me to annotate characters with circumstances as well. The amount of Destiny available to the player felt right, and his choices to use them were always, in my mind, sound. I loved how Doom worked out. Destiny was in short enough supply that there was a lot of temptation for him to use the Doom he got.

Arcs really are motivational. They give a character something to consider in every minor scene. This worked out perfectly.

Less ideal: every random guy needs stats. Coming up with those stats on the fly is challenging. With a tiny bit of preparation, I could've had some fairly good generic Exalted Soldiers, Vengeful Ghost, Giant Automata. This would've gone a long way to making those scenes even more interesting. Also, since each conflict in a single-person game involves the same character, there tends to be a lot of repetition in which traits get used. This isn't a terrible flaw, but requires not skimping on narration of a scene.

Oddly intriguing: Narration of a scene where some element which would normally be contested is assumed. For instance, in finding the secret door into Denandsor, Dave narrated that he was perceptive. Rather than come up with a reason why he might not find the door, I realized that the stakes were really "Will Midnight get inside the city unseen" and so simply said that he found the door but that it was Locked. Similarly, when he said he would sneak past the Sentinels, I knew that it didn't matter if they saw him - there were other obstacles. This really opens up the narrative in a way that's hard to express in writing without a blow-by-blow.

I'm stunned that this much plot can come out of such a flimsy premise. I literally started with "Lost child" and ended up with "Hero and Villain become even more closely tied, as it's revealed that both have souls dating to the first age, based on this city of Denandsor; Hero leaves the tribe he loves in order to protect them from the growing threat." The consequences of conflicts is really what makes this happen. That even losers of a conflict get something really keeps the story going. Figuring out what you want from a conflict other than the obvious is a little difficult to get one's head wrapped around, but really adds a lot to the game.
